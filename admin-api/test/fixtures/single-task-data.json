  "summaryOfActivities": "Conducted final pre-harvest assessment of crop maturity. Evaluated leaf development, checked readiness for reaping, and planned storage methods. Overall crop condition appears ready for harvest with good leaf maturity.",
  "statusIndicator": "green",
  "descriptionOfChallenges": "Some variability in leaf maturity across different sections of the field. Need to ensure proper timing for optimal harvest quality.",
  "recommendedActions": "Proceed with harvest in mature sections first. Implement planned storage method with proper ventilation. Monitor remaining sections for 3-5 days before harvesting.",
